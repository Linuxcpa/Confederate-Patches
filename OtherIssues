These issues stop some packages from compiling. The cause of the underlying problem is unclear. 
It is uncertan if attempts to resolve the underlying problem are being made:

1. Perl cannot be compiled with threads

2. Python 27 will not build all of the modules

3. PHP 54 Dependent programs will fail to create shared libraries

4. Libexecinfo will report that it can't determine the gcc version

5. Numerous programs will report: Trouble resolving symbol -2147477870, including zlib and libintl.

6. Programs dependent upon heirloom-libcommon will fail to find heirloom-libcommon at link time.

7. Programs dependent upon libpcap will fail to find libpcap at link time.

8. A patched Flex, consistant with BEOS patching will allow programs to build that otherwise wouldn't.

9. Some errors that have halted a compilation have later not halted the compilation, or vice versa.

10. Patches between versions of GCC (4 vs 2) do not apply equally, some may only work on 1, but not the other.
