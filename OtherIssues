***Keep in mind, that I used a nightly build, that is not officially supported.***

***I cannot determinbe if any of the issues outlined below are unique to the unsupported build.***

Some issues may be pkgsrc related, or  ***a result of my not knowing how to patch things correctly.***

These issues represent my experience with the operating system, using pkgsrc and with the changes I made to source. 
They stopped a noticeable number of packages from compiling. 

The cause of these underlying problems is unclear.

It is uncertan (to me) if attempts to resolve the underlying problems are possible or being made.

It is very possible that I patched something incorrectly  and was the cause:

1. Perl cannot be compiled with threads

2. Python 27 will not build all of the modules

3. PHP 54 Dependent programs will fail to create shared libraries

4. Libexecinfo will report that it can't determine the gcc version

5. Numerous programs will report at link time: Trouble resolving symbol -2147477870.
This has happened on occassion and to zlib and libintl.

6. Programs dependent upon heirloom-libcommon will fail to find heirloom-libcommon at link time.

7. Programs dependent upon libpcap will fail to find libpcap at link time. 
I am fairly certain I patched something incorrectly here.

8. Different programs seem to bebe able to build or not depending upon how Flex is patched. 
I had different results on occassion when I patched Flex as if it were to be used in BEOS compared to not patching it at all.

9. Some errors that have halted a compilation have later not halted the compilation, or vice versa.
This happened maybe once or twice and I don't know which package. 
This doesn't seem logical, unless it has something to do with Flex.

10. Patches between versions of GCC (4 vs 2) do not apply equally sometimes 
(more rare than not, but noticeable.). Most do work for both.

***The following issues are chronically problematic, of great annoyance, but are unlikely to be remidied.***

1. A writeable /usr directory (There is a work around for this, modify the user boot script)

2. Not having write access to /boot/system

3. It seems that XMS Shared memory has not been implemented, but it is being worked on.

4. Headers don't contain frequently used definitions but are non posix

5. Lack of support for hard links in file system.


***The following chronic functionality issues undermine the usefulness of programs compiled in the system:***

1. There is no clear way to run X11 programs

2. Packages not built inside of Haikuporter can't find their libraries, even though linked without issue.
The libraries are $PATHED properly and some even have the library path embedded in them.

3. Printing driver choices are limited, printing services cannot withstand large jobs.

4. Networking is limited to ftp and email. 
Samba may be possible, but I could not get it to compile, even with patches. 

5. Ocassional kernel panics when files are downloaded from a web browser.

6. NFS is broken

7. CIFS never implemented

8. Lynx has a chronic networking issue, it can't load web pages.

9. Apache can't run, there is a particular issue with mmap I don't understand.

The removal of directories that many previously packaged applications required and the 
inability to restore the directories has had a strong negative impact on developer morale.
