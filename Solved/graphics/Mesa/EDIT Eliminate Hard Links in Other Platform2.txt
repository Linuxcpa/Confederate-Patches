The source code for Mesalib has hard links built into the tar file.
pkgsrc will fetch Mesalib from ftp ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/pkgsrc/distfiles/
Right now, the file system for Haiku does not support hard links.
So extracting the source from the original tar file will fail in Haiku, unless the hard links are removed.

To remove the hard links in Linux, I extracted the archive as I normally would.

I used the following command to zip the source back up the without hard links:

tar --hard-dereference -cvjf
