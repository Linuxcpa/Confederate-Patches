The source code for star-1.4.3 has hard links built into the tar file.
Right now, the file system for Haiku does not support hard links.
So extracting the source from the original tar file will fail in Haiku, unless the hard links are removed.
Pkgsrc will fetch star from ftp ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/pkgsrc/distfiles/star-1.4.3.tar.gz

To remove the hard links, I ftp'd the source into Linux and extracted the archive as I normally would.

I used the following command to zip the source back up the without hard links:

tar --hard-dereference -cvzf star-1.4.3.tar.gz star-1.4.3

I then FTP'd the source back into Haiku and placed it in the distfiles directory, replacing the original.
