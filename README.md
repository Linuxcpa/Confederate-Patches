Confederate-Patches FOR PKGSRC IN HAIKU 
=======================================

USE HKPKGSRC!!!! 

http://code.google.com/p/hpkgsrc/

MY REPOSITORY IS JUST FOR IDEAS.

COME BACK IF YOU ARE DESPERATE.

OR USE IF YOU WANT TO TAKE WHAT I STARTED AND MAKE IT USEABLE.

I am not a programmer. 

I just did whatever I could to get things to compile. 

Sometimes, I had to use a dog's wishbone, or poke a voodoo doll.

***This repository is meant for people who know how to fix what I could not.***

If you see purple smoke coming out the back of your computer, don't be surprised.

In short, use at your own risk and if you know what you are doing.

Because I don't know what I'm doing.

These aren't patches. These are full files.

Don't do pull requests, I couldn't do one if my life depended on it. 

I was lucky to use the Windows client to get these files here.
