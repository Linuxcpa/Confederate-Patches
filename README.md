Confederate-Patches
===================

USE HKPKGSRC!!!! 

http://code.google.com/p/hpkgsrc/

MY REPOSITORY IS JUST FOR IDEAS.

COME BACK IF YOU ARE DESPERATE.

OR USE IF YOU WANT TO TAKE WHAT I STARTED AND MAKE IT USEABLE.

I am not a programmer. I just did whatever I could to get things to compile. 
This repository is meant for people who know to fix what I could not.

In short, use at your own risk and if you know what you are doing.

These aren't patches. These are full files.

Don't do pull requests, I couldn't do one if my life depended on it. 

I was lucky to use the Windows client to get these files here.
